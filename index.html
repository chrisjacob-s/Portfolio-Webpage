        <h2>Hi! I'm Christopher Soriano</h2>
        <p>I live in Cerritos and I am an aspiring software developer!</p>
        <p>I am on track to becoming a software developer because I want to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>create websites that I feel accomplished developing</li>
          <li>get a high-paying job</li>
          <li>be in a career where I can only get better</li>

        </article>
        <article>
          <p>When I am not staring at a computer 8 hours a day, I like to do activities that are both calming and active.</p>
          <p>Although I am very introverted and prefer to stay indoors, I do love experiencing the great outdoors. My favorite activites to do are hiking and kayaking.</p>
          <p>There are still many things I haven't done in my life, but are on my bucket list: visit Japan, go snorkeling, go skydiving, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
          <p>Even though I prefer to work alone, I do love collaborating with others. Working with a team will not only help me learn more about web development, but they can also bring in ideas that I would probably not have thought of.</p>
